**Video Ref**

To allow full customization and control over the video, the video forwards its ref and some methods that you can access using the `useVideoRef` hook those methods are

| Method            | Use case                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| togglePlay        | play and pause the video             |
| toggleCaptions    | show and hide the subtitle component |
| togglePictureMode | toggle picture mode                  |
| toggleMute        | Mute or unmute the video             |
| toggleFullscreen  | enter and exit full screen           |

The video can also but accessed from the ref but calling `ref.current.video`(the name ref depends on how you name your variable)

**Example use case**

```ts
import { Video, useVideoRef } from "react-lite-player";

function App() {
  const video = useVideoRef();

  function togglePlay() {
    video.current?.togglePlay();
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={togglePlay}>toggle play</button>{" "}
      {/*//control the player from your component directly using the forwarded ref */}
      <Video ref={video} url={"url"} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
